# Backpropagation-and-F-adjoint
The main goal of this project is to implement the well-known backpropagation algorithm in an easy manner based on the idea of the F-adjoint propagation proposed in the following arxiv preprint: "[Backpropagation and F-adjoint. arXiv preprint arXiv:2304.13820.](https://arxiv.org/abs/2304.13820)"
